✅ <b>Fastest on the Market</b> - `Pipelines` guarantees rapid performance, thanks to bypassing the reflection mechanism to find the appropriate handler. Efficiency is at the core of our design!

✅ <b>Unparalleled Flexibility</b> - With the capability to craft pipelines based on your own types, you have absolute control over the method inputs and the returned results 


✅ <b>Craft Multiple Pipelines</b> - The freedom to create any number of pipelines within your application, each one can be tailor-made for its specific use case

✅ <b>Minimal Dependency</b> - Developers will see the reference to 'Pipeline' namespace exclusively when they're registering with the AddPipeline() method. Elsewhere in the application, the presence of this library remains undetected.

✅ <b>Type Validators</b> - If you inadvertently provide inconsistent types, such as discrepancies between the dispatcher and handler, type validators will alert you immediately with exceptions, ensuring the integrity and correctness of your configurations.

✅ <b>Designed with Developers in Mind</b> - Built considering the needs of developers, our tool eases and accelerates your work while maintaining the highest standards.
