# üì¢ What is Pipelines?

We believe that a good library should adapt to the application, not the other way. That is why Pipelines grants you the
freedom to create any number of mediators within your application. Each of them can be tailored to specific use cases,
ensuring maximum flexibility in programming. This is possible because:

- Pipelines does not expose its types - it does not require implementing an interface or inheriting from a class. You
  have absolute control over input data and operation results.
- Each mediator built with Pipelines is independent and decoupled from the others.
- To maintain the best performance, we utilized the Source Generator mechanism, which minimizes the use of reflection.
- Decorator support allows you to add additional effects like validation, logging, or even using the Unit of Work
  pattern. Additionally, it enables the construction of the Chain of Responsibility pattern.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
- Pipelines in which multiple handlers will be handled for one input must have a `Task` or `void` return type.
- Cannot create a Pipeline that returns both generic and non-generic types.

-----

# üõ§ Roadmap
- [ ] **ADR Documentation**: Record key architectural decisions made during implementation using ADRs.
- [ ] **Code Cleanup**: Refine and tidy up the codebase post-MVP, paving the way for new feature development.
- [ ] **Support for Nullable Results**: Add functionality to handle nullable result types.
- [x] **Configurable Dispatcher Behavior**: Implement configuration settings to decide if the dispatcher should throw an exception in case there's no handler for a given Input.
- [x] **Dependency Injection Scope Choice**: Provide an option to decide whether or not to create a Dependency Injection Scope in Dispatchers.
- [ ] **Multiple Inputs in Dispatcher**: Enhance the dispatcher handle method to accept a list of inputs instead of just one.
- [ ] **Parallel Pipeline**: Introduce a pipeline to facilitate parallel execution of multiple handlers.
- [ ] **Stream Pipeline**: Implement support for streaming pipelines.
- [ ] **Decorator Performance Optimization**: Improve performance, especially concerning the use of `ActivatorUtilities.CreateInstance()`.
